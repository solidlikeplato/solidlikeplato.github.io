# Linkedin HTML

## Summary
For this challenge, we are going to recreate our LinkedIn Profiles! Before you start, understand that LinkedIn has a team of experienced User Experience (UX), User Interface (UI), and frontend developers to make their website look the way it does. Your website will look like a 6-year old made it.

### Release 0 - Think through the structure
Take a look at your own LinkedIn Profile and think through all the elements on the page. What's on the page? Are things nested under them? How many sections does LinkedIn have?

### Release 1 - Set up the structuce in your HTML body
Setup your `index.html` document with the needed elements. What is the appropriate order of elements on the page? Label these sections. For example:
- Cover Photo
- Div with profile photo, name, title
- About me Div
- Div with a bunch of sub-div's for jobs
- Div for education
- Etc.

### Release 2 - Body Content
Add in the content to your HTML body to make it similar to your LinkedIn profile. Leave styling out! We just want the skeleton.
